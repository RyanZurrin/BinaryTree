# BinaryTree
Data structures project to write a program to test out implementation of a binary search tree.

For this assignment you will need to create a header file for the binary tree, a driver program and two data files called data1.txt and data2.txt.  
The purpose of the driver program is to open data1.txt and load it into an instance of a binary tree.  Once this is done you will need to open and read data2.txt. 
As you are reading the second file you will need to add non-duplicate items to the binary tree.  All duplicate items from both files will need to be written to a file 
called errors.txt and also be removed from the binary tree.  Once all items have been read and non-duplicates have been loaded into the tree you will need to write the 
contents of the binary tree to a file called merged.txt. 

To test your program you will need to create data1.txt and data2.txt manually.  (basically use notepad to create them)  Each file fill contain at least 
50 random real numbers.
